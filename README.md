For now, collecting tutorials.

I'm working with Hyperion and the Raspberry Pi 4 (maybe just a 3 is necessary?)


I've got some resources [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/led/comments/egkot0/rpi4_ws2815/) and that mentions [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LightShowPi/comments/e9ee94/the_control_panel_of_my_setup/?ref=share&ref_source=link) as well.

This is my main resource: [raspberry pi and hyperion ambilight](https://blog.monstermuffin.org/building-a-custom-ambilight-system-for-any-input-with-a-raspberry-pi-and-hyperion/)

This [pi blaster thingy seems cool](https://github.com/sarfata/pi-blaster)

Also, for connecting a [WS2812, here's a walkthrough](https://dordnung.de/raspberrypi-ledstrip/ws2812)

Here's some research on [mean well power supplies](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/mean-well-led-switching-power-supply-hookup-guide/all#:~:text=Connect%20your%20Mean%20Well%20power,the%20Mean%20Well%20output%20voltage.)

Here's an [Adafruit example for the level shifter](https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-wiring)
